# PathfindingGeneticAlgorithm

During this project I created a pathfinding simulation using an evolutionairy algorithm in a two dimensional environment. It's far from perfect but it does find a path from start to goal coordinate (most of the time).

How the program is used:

attached is an eclipse java project which can be easily imported
to change the behavior of the algorithm the four essential variables are: startPopCount, wayLength, mutProbability, crossoverPercent
